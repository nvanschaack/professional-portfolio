## Description
This is a professional portfolio that was created to showcase some of my most impressive pieces of work from my bootcamp class at University of Texas-Austin. This portfolio is a good resource for potential employers to review and assess whether I am a good candidate for an open position. 

## Technologies Used
HTML5,
CSS3

## Usage
In this portfolio, you will be able to see five applications I have created in the **work** section. In order to view each application, you can click on the image, which acts like a button, and you will be brought to that specific web application. Also, within the portfolio there are navigation links to help you maneuver on the page easier, depending on what exactly you want to view. Contact information is listed at the bottom of the page for how to best contact me.
